Describe, in painstaking detail, the steps I want the program to do: 
1: Fetch u.gg counters page for cell B2 champion name (Aatrox)
2: List champions horizontally starting in cell H2 in the "best picks vs X champion" section from greatest winrate to lowest. Lowest acceptable winrate is 51%. Any listed counter from "best picks vs X champ" must have at least 200 games played 
3: After listing each counter within the parameters, go to the u.gg counters page of the next champ on "Champion cast" spreadsheet
Repeat actions listed in 2
