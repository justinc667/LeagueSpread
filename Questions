Why do we leave the parenthesis blank after myfunction and fetchfun? In case we want arguments. Also, java does not recognize the syntax unless you write them in
Why do they need a squiggle after them? To determine a strip that goes inside grammatically? 
Will we be changing the var on line 6? How does one change a variable in js? Guide recommends using let instead of var as var is outdated. Saw how to chage them
Can stripfribbage only list items when they have spaces between them? What about underscores or other symbols? Any character has an index value that can be manipulated. Spaces are also counted for other argumes like strip
Would typical notes have another // at the end of the note or line normally? I remember the // vs /* section of the book mentioning that those sets of symbols flank the beginning and the end of the comment. Not just the beginning
How does print work? print (defined_term)? print (text/sting/variable/constant); pretty much what I expected

Describe, in painstaking detail, the steps I want the program to do: 
1: Fetch u.gg counters page for cell B2 champion name (Aatrox)
2: List champions horizontally starting in cell H2 in the "best picks vs X champion" section from greatest winrate to lowest. Lowest acceptable winrate is 51%. Any listed counter from "best picks vs X champ" must have at least 200 games played 
3: After listing each counter within the parameters, go to the u.gg counters page of the next champ on "Champion cast" spreadsheet
Repeat actions listed in 2
